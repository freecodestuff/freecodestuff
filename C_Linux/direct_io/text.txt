The function posix_memalign() allocates size bytes and places the address of the allocated memory in *memptr. The address of the allocated memory will be a multiple of alignment, which must be a power of two and a multiple of sizeof(void *). If the size is 0, then posix_memalign() returns either NULL or a unique pointer value that can later successfully pass to free(3) The function posix_memalign() allocates size bytes and places the address of the allocated memory in *memptr.
